Teletubbyland is the place of the Teletubbies. It is the away in the hills. Let me introduce
you the main characters.
• Tinky Winky is the first Teletubby, as well as the largest and oldest of the group.
He is covered in purple terrycloth and has a triangular antenna on his head. He
often carries a red bag.
• Dipsy is the second Teletubby. He is green and named after his antenna, which
resembles a dipstick. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will
occasionally refuse to go along with the group opinion.
• Laa-Laa is the third Teletubby. She is yellow and has a curly antenna. Laa-Laa
is very sweet, likes to sing and dance, and is often shown looking out for the other
Teletubbies.
• Po is the fourth Teletubby, as well as the shortest and youngest. She is red and has
an antenna shaped like a stick used for blowing soap bubbles. Her favourite toy is
a pink and blue scooter.
